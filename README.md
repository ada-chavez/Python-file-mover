Scenario: Your employer wants a program to move all his .txt files from one folder to another
with the click of a click of a button. On your desktop make 2 new folders. Call one Folder A &
the second Folder B. Create 4 random .txt files & put them in Folder A.
Plan:

-Move the files from Folder A to Folder B.

-Print out each file path that got moved onto the shell.

-Upon viewing Folder A after the execution, the moved files should not be there.

Guidelines:
- Use Python 2.7 .x on this drill.
- Import the shutil module.
- Run it on the python shell.
- Use the IDLE for this Drill.
Once you have created the program, show your work to the instructor for a pass.
